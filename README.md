# Spark-LSTM-Prediction
An attemp to use Apache Spark and TensorFlow Keras LSTM to predict London Electricity Usage. 

The project is based on Kaggle London Smart Meter dataset, within which only whether data is used.Therefore, the outcome is not optimal, though general trend could be seen. A more well rounded dataset could possibly improve loss.
